A port of my ruby harmony library. Good for representing and manipulating concepts in
music theory, which takes a slightly abstracted/mathematical approach to modelling them.

Why?

Currently just an excuse for me to play with scala and some of the associated toolchain.

I'm following the bleeding edge of 2.8 development at the moment, mainly because its
new collection stuff makes it a lot easier to give PitchSet etc a nice set-like API.
But also just because I wanna try it out.

Examples of use to come.

Build:

Needs sbt (http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/)
with 
http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/LocalScala
because of the 2.8 stuff.


sbt
> update
> compile

will do it.
I also like to use sbt's

> console

to compile and play with it
